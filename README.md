Lung cancer prediction using histopathological images

The project involves the collection and analysis of a comprehensive dataset comprising histopathological lung tissue images. The color image dataset (LC25000) consists of benign and malignant lung tissue images. Carcinomas of the lung are among the most common sources of invasive cancer and are the two most common causes of cancer deaths in America. These images will be preprocessed to enhance features and remove noise, followed by feature extraction to identify key characteristics associated with cancerous and non-cancerous lung tissues.
